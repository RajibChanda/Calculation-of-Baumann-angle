# Project title
Calculation of Baumann angle using deep learning methods.

## Description


## Dataset
The dataset used is publicly available [Musculoskeletal Radiographs (MURA)](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/mura/)  dataset from Standford ML group. The MURA dataset consist of X-ray images of elbows. The objective is to calculate the Baumann angle from the X-ray images. The images are not annotated by default and looks like this:
![MURA dataset](imgs/image1.png)
![MURA dataset](imgs/image2.png)
So, the images are labelled with [Labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) for 8 distinct points. 

## Libraries used
